# Install:
# - git (and git-lfs), for git operations (to e.g. push your work).
#   Also required for setting up your configured dotfiles in the workspace.
# - sudo, while not required, is recommended to be installed, since the
#   workspace user (`gitpod`) is non-root and won't be able to install
#   and use `sudo` to install any other tools in a live workspace.
